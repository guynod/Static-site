# Testing Our New Blog Layout

This is a test post to verify that our new blog layout is working correctly. We should see:

1. A proper placeholder image at the top
2. This post appearing in the three-column grid
3. Correct formatting of the date and excerpt
4. Proper spacing and alignment

## Testing Typography

Here's some sample content to test different typography elements:

> This is a blockquote that should be properly styled and indented.

And here's a code snippet:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

Let's see how it all comes together!
